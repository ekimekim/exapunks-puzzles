or something like that.


control room contains control rod hardware reg,
read to get control rod setting, write -1 or +1 to change it.
water pump has pump reg to control water flow rate
turbine room has output reg for water output temperature
cap room has output chamber pressure
undecided: reactor may contain geiger counter showing activity,
but reactor should not be enterable (all links not traversable)
maybe also contain some cosmetics: control rod regs (showing same output as main one)
and files containing fuel cells

entire system is a dynamic, per cycle simulation.
relevant variables are:
chamber temperature
activity
water flow rate
water input temperature
water output temperature
control rod setting

in formulae below,
assume there's also tweakable coefficients to affect relative strength of each term

the activity is a function of the previous activity and control rod:
activity(t) = (passive + rolling average(prev activity)) * control rod coefficient based on setting
control rod coefficient should be between 0 and 1 (but never perfectly 0), decreasing with
increasing setting, such that max setting fairly quickly scrams the reactor (reduces activity
to near zero) and min setting fairly quickly causes exponential increase.
rolling average is meant to represent prompt vs delayed neutrons by putting heavy emphasis
on recent activity and then a long tail of past activity.
note activity is unstable (almost impossible to get perfectly balanced, will either
decrease or increase over time in positive feedback loop).
the idea is that you have to actively manage it.

chamber pressure is directly correlated to temperature, it's basically just a way
of displaying the temperature.
temperature(t) = temperature(t-1) + increase from activity - decrease from cooling
decrease from cooling = flow rate * (difference between input and output temperature)
input temperature is arbitrary and constant, might as well be 0
output temperature = temperature(t-1)
note this means that d/dt of temperature = activity - flow * temperature,
and so with constant activity and flow, temperature = activity / flow + k e^-(flow * t),
ie. the temperature will asymtote to a value proportional to activity and inversely proportional to flow.

power output = flow rate * (output temperature - base output temperature)
base output temperature should be 100C to represent steam at air pressure

note that higher flow rates make temperature level out quicker and lowers it,
but lower temperatures suffer more losses to base output temperature,
which means needing to drive more activity, which is harder to control.
but a flow rate too low might not be able to deliver enough power
without getting close or over critical pressure

if pressure (aka temperature) goes too high, chamber bursts and reactor melts down

reactor is "shut down" if activity is below a threshold for a length of time


three puzzles, increasing difficulty:
	basic safety: watch pressure and SCRAM (control rods to max, pumps to full) if too high
		NPC is controlling rods/pumps
	constant output: controlling only control rods, regulate output for target temperature
	variable output: manage control rods and pumps to manage activity, temperature, and power output
		so that power output is within a % of requested output. request changes over time.
		will always end in shutting down the reactor (requested power = 0).
		goal is to have power within % of requested output for X cycles, so getting there quicker/
		being more accurate gives you improved cycle count.

narrative:
	your incompetent cousin is a tech at a nuclear plant, lied on his resume, needs you to hack in
	and manage reactor so he isn't caught.
	exa control system exists because corp is paying big $$$ for high tech new control software,
	but it's not ready yet, so in the meantime they have human techs working.
	you need to do the human's jobs. early puzzles have humans doing tasks you aren't
	(eg. "i'm controlling the reactor but i don't want to blow shit up, watch my back" for first task,
	then later becomes "control the whole thing for me")
