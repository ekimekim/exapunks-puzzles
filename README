A repo for managing and developing exapunks custom puzzles.

Each puzzle is a js file under ~/.local/share/EXAPUNKS/<steam id>/custom/

In this repo, puzzles are normally-named files in the local directory,
which get 'installed' according to saved associations.

This is managed via the manage.py tool, with the following commands:
	python manage.py configure STEAMID
		This writes the steam id to a file steamid, to avoid checking it in anywhere.
	python manage.py associate GAME_FILE LOCAL_FILE
		This copies the existing GAME_FILE to LOCAL_FILE, and saves the association
		in file associations.json
	python manage.py install {LOCAL_FILE}
		Copies given (or all) files to game directory files associated with them.
